# Create-an-AI-agent-to-fill-forms-from-your-private-documents
This project extracts required information with prompt engineering and then completes HTML forms. Using LLAMA2 hosted by IBM watsonx.ai for text analysis and Flask as a back-end web app, this system significantly improves efficiency in handling form fields -- reducing the need for manual input and expediting the entire form-filling process.
