# Create-an-AI-agent-to-fill-forms-from-your-private-documents
This project extracts required information with prompt engineering and then completes HTML forms. Using LLAMA2 hosted by IBM watsonx.ai for text analysis and Flask as a back-end web app, this system significantly improves efficiency in handling form fields -- reducing the need for manual input and expediting the entire form-filling process.

# At a Glance
This project harnesses the power of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLM) to streamline the process of completing forms using AI. By employing prompt engineering, it extracts necessary information from private documents and automatically fills HTML forms, significantly reducing manual input and expediting the form-filling process. The system utilizes LLAMA2 hosted by IBM Watsonx.ai for text analysis and Flask as a backend web app, offering a robust solution for handling form fields efficiently.

# Introduction
No one enjoys filling out forms, yet they are ubiquitous in various aspects of life, from loan applications to visa processes. This project aims to provide a quicker and easier way to complete forms by leveraging artificial intelligence. Imagine an AI agent capable of reading required information and automatically populating form fields accurately and instantly. This project brings this vision to reality.

# Features
- Automated Form Filling: Streamlines the process of completing forms by automatically inserting relevant information into the appropriate fields.
- Document Processing: Efficiently processes and analyzes a collection of documents, extracting and understanding the content to find relevant information for form completion.
- Integration of AI Models: Utilizes IBM Watsonx-hosted LLMs to interpret form requirements and generate accurate, contextually relevant responses for each field.
- Accessible Interface: Utilizes Flask to provide a practical and accessible way to interact with the form-filling service. Flask handles web requests, integrates with other Python tools, and offers a scalable and deployable solution.
